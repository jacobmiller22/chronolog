# Contributing to Chronolog
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## The Projects Objective

Chronolog is an open-source command-line application that allows its users to chronologically log information about their day (hence the name). It was initially created to eleminate the tedious task of creating and organizing documents to log events, findings, progress, and more during the workday.
